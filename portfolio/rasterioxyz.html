          <p>
            In my previous role, we regularly dealt with large swathes of commercial very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite and aerial imagery. 
            Not only was this data required by in-house imagery analysts for property damage assessment but for display on the client-facing 
            insurance exposure and claims platform. Such imagery was typically divided into constituent tiles, significant in total volume, 
            in less common format (e.g., .tif and .tfw, MrSID), and projected in a local CRS (e.g., UTM zones). With this in mind, the third-party 
            mapping service employed by the company - where a majority of client-facing data was hosted - impose several constraints on the data 
            uploaded to their platform:
            <ul>
              <li>Must be byte (uint8) data type</li>
              <li>Must be GeoTIFF format</li>
              <li>Must be projected in either EPSG:3857 or EPSG:4326, though data projected in the latter is reprojected on the service-side</li>
              <li>Must be less than 300 MB when uploaded through the web platform or 10 GB through the API</li>
              <li>Must upload and process within a one hour timeout when uploaded through the web platform</li>
              <li>Must be uploaded as a whole and cannot be appended to an existing dataset</li>
              <li>Lengthy processing on the service-side comprising tiling of data into a proprietary format</li>
              <li>Often longer than expected upload times, especially through the API where large datasets appeared to stall</li>
              <li>Hosting costs, albeit with a generous free tier</li>
            </ul> 
            These combined necessitated identification of a fast, inexpensive alternative. Despite having used XYZ tiles through the entirety 
            of my career thus far, as well as much of my geospatial education, it was discovery of the simplicity in serving these from cloud 
            storage that they became the clear choice.
            <br><br>
            In practice, these were generated within QGIS, written to local storage, then uploaded to Azure Blob Storage via the Azure SDK 
            for Python, AzCopy, or Azure Storage Explorer. While largely fire-and-forget tasks, this workflow required manual intervention between
            steps. Furthermore, with larger datasets, QGIS' CPU and memory use during tiling often made the machine on which it was running near unusable.
            <br><br>
            Inspired by a need to automate the tiling of commercial high-resolution satellite and aerial imagery, rasterioxyz is a 
            lightweight, low-dependency Python package for tiling georeferenced rasterio datasets according to the XYZ tiles standard.
            Most, if not all, geospatial professionals will have used XYZ tiles at some point, be it OpenStreetMap or Google Satellite.
            Many of these may have created their own XYZ dataset(s) at another. It is my hope that this package may be of use to those
            seeking a clean, efficient, and easily integrated way to do so in their own applications.

          While, at present, several times slower than QGIS' equivalent functionality, rasterioxyz utilises just one thread compared
          to QGIS' 16 in testing on the same machine.
